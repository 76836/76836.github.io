# VirtualOS
Maybe it'll work...
go to https://76836.tk to try it!

Hey, if you have any programming skills, (unlike me) would you make your own branch and help me make VirtualOS better?
I'm trying to make an android simulator that feels like an emulator, but it integrates with all the features of your device, oh and yeah, I want this to work on every device ever.

I'll add a chat feature into VirtualOS later if you want to grill me ;)
