<h1>FAQ:</h1>
<p>How do I uninstall an app?:</p>
<p>You have to clear the app index, uninstalling every app at once. Uninstalling just one app is unavailable but will be added in a future update.</p> 
<p>How do I download files onto Mist?</p>
<p>Mist doesnt support downloading files, the closest substitute is setting up your own http server.</p>
